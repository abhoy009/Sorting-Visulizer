# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based application for visualizing various sorting algorithms in action.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed
- Multiple sorting algorithms implemented:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- Time and space complexity information for each algorithm

## Usage

1. Adjust the "Size of the array" slider to set the number of elements to sort.
2. Use the "Speed of the algorithm" slider to control the visualization speed.
3. Click "Generate New Array" to create a new random array.
4. Select a sorting algorithm from the available options to start the visualization.

## Time Complexity

The application displays time complexity information for each sorting algorithm:
- Worst case
- Average case
- Best case

## Space Complexity

Space complexity information is also provided for each algorithm.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
  
## Deployment

This project is deployed using Netlify and can be accessed at: [https://phenomenal-raindrop-040dd3.netlify.app/]
